This is my first project in HTML, it is very bare bones
as no CSS or Javascript is included yet.

The purpose of this little project is to practice the 
html basics elements like:
- Create an index file
- Create paragraphs
- Create lists
- Insert images
- Insert links
- Maintain an ordered enviroment thru folder hierarchy
